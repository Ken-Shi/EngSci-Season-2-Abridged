# EngSci Season 2 Abridged
### What This Is
These are my personal notes for some of my second-term courses at the University of Toronto's Engineering Science program. Feel free to use them, but know that they're just my notes so there may be some inaccuracy in them. I hope they're useful!

### How to Use
Click on the `MAT195.pdf` or `CSC190.pdf` to see the nice, polished, LaTeX'd notes. If you want to play around or look at the raw .tex, check those out.
